# Chemistry Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)  
This is a deployment example of **Chemotion**, an open-source Electronic Lab Notebook designed for organic chemists.  

## About the ELN  
[Click here to visit the ELN](https://reaction.qutesun.me). You can register and explore its features.  

It relies on a free vps, to minimise the cost of the potential charge, this ELN was configured to be closed between 9pm-9am Beijing time, and up between 9am-9pm during the day.

### **Important Notice**  
This is a **personal project** and will be terminated by **January 2026**.  
Please **do not use it for any serious or production-level projects**.

## Deployment Details  
This ELN is hosted on **Digital Ocean** (digitalocean.com) and is based on the open-source **[Chemotion ELN](https://github.com/ComPlat/chemotion_ELN)**. Special thanks to the Chemotion team for developing such a powerful tool for organic chemists.  

The deployment uses the following technologies:  
- **Docker-Compose**: To manage and orchestrate the service.  
- **Nginx**: As a reverse proxy to enhance security and optimize performance.
